# bus-mall

this project is an assignment from Codefellows.

this project is about displaying three unique products by chance so that the viewers can pick a favorite.
And after 25 Attempts two buttons appear to show and hide the results.
the results contain how many time the user select that image and how many times it appears with its name.

April/13/2021: the products generated are not duplicates from the immediate previous set, and the Bar chart from Chart.js Library
